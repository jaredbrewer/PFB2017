Jared by Shel Silverstein

Jared loves me,
Jared cares,
Jared picks me peaches and pears.
Jared offers me candy and Cokes,
Jared listens and laughs at me jokes.
Jared helps when I get in a fight,
Jared does all my homework at night.
Jared misses me,
Jared cries,
Jared thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Jared is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Jared just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Jared's hand,
In the darkness where Jared usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Jared's gone!
